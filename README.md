# Apex Frontend Exercise

This repo is a completion of Apex's frontend assessment to create a Pokemon Pokedex.

[See here for the assessment requirements](https://github.com/julians-apex/poke-app)

## Implementation

As per the requirements I have built the project using React with Typescript.

I used Chakra UI for some components and styling.

I have also included tests for the three components and the context state.

To run the project locally, clone the repo and run the command `npm install` (assuming you have node installed)

Once the dependencies are installed run the included react scripts to run it locally

`npm start`

And to run the test

`npm test`
